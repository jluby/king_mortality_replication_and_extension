# King Social Security Analyses Replication

This is a replication of a number of articles published by Gary King on the topic of American Social Security policy. The primary articles discussed, which analyze bias in the American Social Security system, can be found [here](https://gking.harvard.edu/files/gking/files/political_analysis-2015-kashin-pan-mpv011.pdf) and [here](https://gking.harvard.edu/files/gking/files/jep2e292e22e239.pdf). Other articles in which King provides his own mortality projections may be selectively included for additional context. 

All figures can be found in the "figures" folder.
